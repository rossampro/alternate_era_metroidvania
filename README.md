# The Final Sound Alternate Era 2D Metroidvania

This repository will hold all of the source code and assets for the Alternate
Era video game called "The Final Sound". This game will be completely written
in Rust and taking advantage of the [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org)
Rust video game engine. This will be a great learning experience for me and a
great way to create something even more meaningful for Alternate Era's lore
and universe
